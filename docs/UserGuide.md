**TA-Assist** is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TA) to keep track of students’ particulars and allocate marks 
for attendance and assignments. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while having the benefits of 
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This user guide provides a brief documentation on how you can install the application and describes how each feature 
should be used. Start by looking at the quick start guide to get you started.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have **Java `11`** or above installed in your Computer.

1. **Copy** the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TA-Assist.
1. **Double-click** the file to start the app.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Before diving into the features, the examples in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  * e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  * e.g `n/NAME [c/CLASS_NAME]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/CS1231S` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times.
  * e.g. `[c/CLASS_NAME...]` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times since it is also optional), `c/CS1101S`, `c/CS2030 c/ST2334` etc.
* Parameters, excluding the index parameter, can be in any order.
  * e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
  * e.g. while `assign INDEX c/CLASS_NAME` is acceptable, `assign c/CLASS_NAME INDEX` is not acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, the parser takes the last occurrence of the parameter.
  * e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, the parser takes `p/56785678` only.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) are ignored.
  * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, the parser interprets it as `help`.

In TA-Assist, you can switch into a mode called the **focus** mode, which lets you run tasks that are specific to (module) class. Therefore,
[some commands](#features-available-in-focus-mode) can only be executed when you are in focus mode. Commands that you can run in the default (unfocused) mode can also
be run in focus mode. On the other hand, commands that are available only in focus mode cannot be executed in the default (unfocused) mode.

Let's first begin with the commands available in the default mode.
